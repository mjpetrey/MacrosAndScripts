This is a repository of various Excel macros, Google Apps Scripts, and other codes I have written and used.    
**MathFormatMacro**: An Excel Macro made for Achievement Network that formats the spreadsheet and saves a pdf version of it.  
**ScrubbingMacro**: An Excel Macro that thoroughly and safely cleans data before analysis. See the macro itself for details.  
**StarMover**: A Google Script made for Achievement Network to create and organize spreadsheets.  
**VMerge**: A Google Script that vertically merges blocks of data. Works in the new Google Sheets.
**DateStamp**: A Google Script used to note the time a cell in a particular column is edited.
