# Portfolio  
This is a repository of various Excel macros, Google Apps Scripts, and other codes I have written and used.    
**Math Format Macro**: An Excel Macro made for Achievement Network that formats the spreadsheet according to company style guides and saves a pdf version of it.  
**Scrubbing Macro**: An Excel Macro made for the NZ Ministry for the Environment that thoroughly and safely cleans text, date, numeric data before analysis. See the macro itself for details.
**Star Mover**: A Google Script made for Achievement Network to create and organize spreadsheets. The manual system used to be paper stars we moved by hand across the wall, thus the name. 
**VMerge**: A Google Script that vertically merges blocks of data. Works in the new Google Sheets.
**Date Stamp**: A Google Script used to note the time a cell in a particular column is edited.
